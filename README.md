# The-World-Happiness-Report-Analysis

Attributes of this dataset have been explained below.
Variable	Description
- Country	                      Name of the country
- Region	                      Region the country belongs to
- Happiness Rank	              Rank of the country based on the Happiness Score
- Happiness Score	              A metric measured in 2016 by asking the sampled people the question: "How would you rate your happiness?"
- Lower Confidence Interval   	Lower Confidence Interval of the Happiness Score
- Upper Confidence Interval	    Upper Confidence Interval of the Happiness Score
- Economy (GDP per Capita)	    The extent to which GDP contributes to the calculation of the Happiness Score
- Family	                      The extent to which Family contributes to the calculation of the Happiness Score
- Health (Life Expectancy)	    The extent to which Life expectancy contributes to the calculation of the Happiness Score
- Freedom	                      The extent to which Freedom contributes to the calculation of the Happiness Score
- Trust (Government Corruption)	The extent to which Trust contributes to the calculation of the Happiness Score
- Generosity	                  The extent to which Generosity contributes to the calculation of the Happiness Score
- Dystopia Residual	            Dystopia is an imaginary country that has the world's least-happy people. The residuals, or unexplained components, differ for each country, reflecting the extent to which the six variables either over- or under-explain average 2014-2016 life evaluations. These residuals have an average value of approximately zero over the whole set of countries

# World Happiness Report Dashboard Narrative
Welcome to the World Happiness Report Dashboard, which provides a visual analysis of global happiness scores and the key factors influencing them. This dashboard comprises four main visualizations that help us explore patterns, relationships, and regional differences in happiness.

## 1. Correlation Heatmap
The first chart is a heatmap that shows the correlation between various attributes contributing to happiness, such as GDP per Capita, Family, Healthy Life Expectancy, Freedom, Trust in Government, Generosity, and the overall Happiness Score.

The heatmap allows us to quickly identify strong positive or negative relationships among these factors.

For instance, we can observe how GDP per Capita and Healthy Life Expectancy are strongly correlated with higher Happiness Scores, while other factors like Generosity may have a smaller but notable effect.

This chart provides a foundation for understanding which attributes are key drivers of happiness globally.

## 2. Scatter Plot: GDP per Capita vs Happiness Score
The second chart is a scatter plot that examines the relationship between GDP per Capita and Happiness Score, with countries colored by Region.

This visualization helps us identify patterns and trends across different regions.

We can see that countries with higher GDP per Capita generally tend to have higher Happiness Scores, although there are exceptions influenced by other social and political factors.

Regional coloring allows us to compare economic influence on happiness across continents and groups of countries.

## 3. Pie Chart: Happiness Score by Region
The third visualization is a pie chart showing the distribution of Happiness Scores by Region.

This chart provides a clear proportional view of global happiness, highlighting which regions contribute the most to the overall happiness scores.

It also allows for a quick comparison between continents, showing regional disparities in happiness.

## 4. Choropleth Map: GDP per Capita with Healthy Life Expectancy Tooltip
The fourth visualization is a world map (choropleth) displaying GDP per Capita by country, with Healthy Life Expectancy shown as a tooltip.

This map offers a geographical perspective on economic prosperity and health across the globe.

Hovering over a country shows its GDP per Capita along with the Healthy Life Expectancy, helping us explore how wealth and health influence happiness geographically.

We can observe clusters of high GDP and life expectancy in regions like North America and Western Europe, while other regions show lower economic and health metrics.

# Conclusion
Together, these visualizations provide a comprehensive view of global happiness patterns.

The heatmap identifies the key factors affecting happiness.

The scatter plot highlights the economic influence and regional differences.

The pie chart offers an overview of happiness contributions by region.

The map connects economic and health indicators with geographical locations.

This dashboard serves as an insightful tool for policymakers, researchers, and anyone interested in understanding the complex factors that contribute to human happiness worldwide.
